# 🚀 Web Dev Mastery: Zero to Hero
> **A project-based roadmap to mastering Full-Stack Development. Don't just read—BUILD.**

This repository is designed for anyone who wants to learn web development by doing. Instead of getting stuck in "tutorial hell," you will follow a step-by-step path from a simple profile page to a full-stack blog application.

---

##  My Learning Philosophy
1. **Commented Code:** Every file has detailed comments explaining the *syntax* and the *logic*.
2. **Increasing Difficulty:** Each project adds 10% more difficulty.
3. **No Copy-Pasting:** Look at the code, understand the logic, and try to build it yourself!
